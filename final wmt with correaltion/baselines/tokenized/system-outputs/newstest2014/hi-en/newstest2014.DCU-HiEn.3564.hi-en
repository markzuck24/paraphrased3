the scientists on this subject , and the light is that a lot of the tail of the dog and what relationship between haia in mood
previous research shows that happy dog to its tail , more are moving on the right , from the point of view of the ( dog ) , while getting his tail as the dog from the left side of the main haina more .
but now , scientists say that the tail of the dog is with this distinction can identify the subtle and can express haina response
the study , published in the journal was kront bayaloji haia
a professor from the university of trento neuroscientist zorjia vallertigara said : &quot; like all human beings , it is good to know that the left and the right part of the brain that excitement , including from the different ways in which the positive or negative emotions to haia . &quot;
yahan we see it also in other species of haia
he said that , like humans , even in the dog baayen dayam part of the brain , a lot of the hand and was responsible for the opposite order , and two different roles in the feelings golards nibhaia
to learn more about this , that the dog to other dogs of the unilateral move by the tail on how to respond to the other dogs , the researchers see the films on rakhya animals
he had the heart of domestic dogs dhadkanon measured and their behavior to the analysis of kiyaa
we understand , probably not take more time in that one side of his tail , sometimes , on the other hand , why moving haia
prof.a. vallertigara said : &quot; we have dogs , the dogs with the movies - yathaarthvadi version or confusion in the other issues to deal with , and in the trips , we can see the tail hua and more to the left or right of the tail can present thea . &quot;
when the animals to a stolid dog his tail right from the point of view of the ( dog ) , they saw moving to rhea
but when he changed the direction of the tail from the left side ( again , from the point of view of the dog ) saw his heart around , and he was the dhadkan respectively.during restless dikhea
according to the vallertigara prof.a .. they don &apos;t think that the dog through the act of deliberately to communicate with one another , thea
instead , they think that dogs have learned from their experience , it is that they should be worried at what hua and naheena on
he said : &quot; if you get from other dogs have many times , and if they are to continue their tail , shake a hand , it is related to more doostana behavior , and dayam part is less doostana behavior , on the basis of that experience , you do haina response . &quot;
researchers say that the conclusion of the owners , doctors and trainers to the feelings of the animals can provide better information about haina
university of bristol &apos;s school of the guest fellow veterneri sciences of the behaviour of the dogs , the expert john bradshaw said that for it to its jaanch is not the first study that dogs bayam or dayam part for important or naheena
last year , university of lincoln &apos;s team found that when the dog to see an aggressive dog , the left side of his head around and happy to see his head on a dog right around haina
the university of victoria in canada in other research , he said : &quot; contrary to the italian study - when the robot dog &apos;s tail on the right than on the left , so did the dogs instead of getting more of his nearest pahunchne thia likely . &quot;
he said that the difference was , therefore , because different studies in animals in films or the robot dogs are not fully understood thea machinery.this
he made clear that it has real dogs by the dog to respond to the study of the ways you can help haia
&quot; while the various mammals found much of the evidence that the two parts of the brain used for different purposes , to be more detailed information is still the rest - and in this case , dogs are not the exception , &quot; he kahaa
however , their behaviour , which easily can be recorded , think that we perhaps understand that not more time to take a side , sometimes his tail , sometimes on the other hand , why moving haia

in the eyes of my classmates were tears of joy , and my parents had each received a letter to keep the news to save liyaa
a group of young , visionary people , the white house was going to be , and the country is ready for change thaa
in the year 2008 , during president obama &apos;s of their 82 per cent approval rating thia
and then i book dia
the reality of the present is a hard truth , such as that from the world of dreams , returned to the anaa
the memory of those days , the hope is hard to do - they seem to be a distant memory , lost opportunities are a tragic yada
my vote for the first time to be laid by the change in fact huaa
easy to say , as in any of it , can &apos;t imagine thaa
i watched obama give a lot of credit hoon , afordable care act to the withdrawal of our troops from iraq , &quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &quot; the end to the killing of osama bin laden taka

if , at the age of 18 years , i should take the guess was that the system of government , the political campaign to bring it forward to contradict haia
it is obvious that elected office is not the way a predictably , because the opposition political parties and random events such as neutown massacre , we provide to the public discussion kregia size
however , i have given the example above , for the most part , they were selected by the administration itself to haina
it belongs to the most gajrani haia
i again for obama in the 2012 vote , but not because i &apos;m thrilled with his obema thaa
binyamin has lost to a confused and presented an option , which that his policies or to determine their position does not seem to be as thaa
i felt that a second term for obama , which is that the future will be free from the pressure of the elections , will complete those hopes to which we are hearing from a long time haina
however , while obama &apos;s anumeadan rating this week , is less than 45 per cent , from the book of the year in 2008 was a very difficult haia return

george scots post.on kerevana bureau has given the options
one day , freedom , and the fear of a story
this time we have been given a warning that the condition of the i.yu. membership in the whole of europe , as in the independent travel sector to be included in the form of the need for an independent scotland hogia
the passport control on bravik hadrian used on the walls and the limit in the wire , indicate the stories about haina
it is true that the rest of europe strathclyde papers with the potential economic benefits of the independent kolis in the description , though - to predict - not the description in the hadlience huaa
not a description that most of the time his i.yu. member to his formal rules to change their reservations in haina
now as scotland shengen area is not , therefore , in brussels , in fact , is also from scotland who want to get , he sustained garr-anupalan brussels in return for cheap concession of hogia
so , then , a-khania
and that is such a long time , he was caught in the first innings haia i &quot; is the meaning of independence , passport control , &quot; they heard about 40 years ago , the news thia
however , this interesting story to tell from the interesting point in gyaa lost
also , independent scotland to europe &apos;s biding should expect to do ?
the london to brussels of why the yok cry-vikray , especially now ?
the real european news : the europe of the great , yudh-pst plan to eventually stopped haia
with the euro crisis , as europe , the project has to be the official haia dead
the opposition in the whole i.yu. i.yu. or in the form of a common currency , the euro , to close to the party for the strength to get haina
even in germany , the eurosceptil alternative for germany , the party - which was established this year - all of a sudden the federal election in september and about half a million votes were received , and thus free heavyweight ( the equivalent of our own libaas dames -rrb- effectively out of the bundestag kiyaa
the construction of a federal europe , the plan was always of the domestic opposition haia
but the current economic crisis , proved to be a radical privaratantors huaa
berlin and the european central bank were imposed by the strict rules of the common currency , to comply with the national economies through the barriers to a lot of people think the reason is that the project was running too far haia europe
excessive budget deficit of national governments in the euro crisis was not very much of the role - it only in the case of greece thaa truth .
but the euro system , its members in favour of the german exporters of the currency exchange rate fixed to - something that made you want to keep the german politician haina
the possibility of the domestic currency devalued , southern europe without their you in germany , compared to a loss of productivity in the state could builtin haia
it is the only way to reduce the pay and public expenditure - which was encouraged by the berlin haia
on budget and currency problems ahead of deep european productivity haia valued
on the consumer expenditure , the french and the german energy firms to provide free - brussels was put in by the &quot; green &quot; energy policies , european industry as a result of the united nations in comparison to the electricity and gas doubled to four times the payment to the haina
this is the cost of the damage to the disabled , which we have already seen in the grangeymouth haia
all salaries in the world to also be freej petrochemical , european industry to cheap u.s. shell is not affected by the gas from the remaining sakataa
as a result , in the spirit of the people is the people , especially in france , which is on the main was never i.yu. thaa fan .
after france &apos;s top yuddh the politicians to keep the i.yu. , germany , and paris in the world to provide equal billing of vanshighton measures in the form of thaa
but the political legitimacy of the berlin now in the form of a passport for the paris is not required , and on the europe of their own economic policies are implemented , that france &apos;s economy was dagmaga haia
the result : a marine lee payne , of the opposition national front i.yu. recently in the byelection in the ruling socialist pushed on to third place of haia
this time , france 24 per cent of the vote in front of is the most popular with the british labour party - it is a warning to the course that they are not , as it can on the left , to the right of the post.on autoloads heagaa for profit
lee payne french white , working class in the middle of his new found fame with what ?
the next year , this party , the use of the european parliament elections i.yu. i.yu. in sarvanisht mudra anti-hindi , wants to create a rival group haia
if , as is quite possible , in these elections i.yu. opposition to good performance , this kind of group , the first time the european parliament can affect haia
my point is this : as soon as possible in europe i.yu. sarvanisht mudra anti-hindi and feelings to the confluence of the bureau to degaa
as of the end of the euro , but it will not be , retail &quot; ( arena ) , a europe of the nations &quot; will be back in the form of access that general de gaulle &apos;s support hogaa
germany and its attendant to some japanes bureau can be made , but france and southern europe , restart your mudraayen karengea
i expect that the najdeekiyan .s. with the expected increase in the uk itself away from this project rakhegaa
however , the increase in the pacific vanshighton interest indicate that britain is left in the cold atlantic jayegaa
after all , what of scotland ?
we , the area of the little england ( must ) be made can choose haina
his own , or we can protect the economic interests of berlin and brussels - which are to be on the right time to tell the different include haia
i think that scotland loose in the european system can do better xiii , provided that we are its own currency rakhena
the garr-union countries in europe , and the other countries of the same thinking , easy to work with live hogaa
otherwise , we run on the way to norway , to maintain its economic independence , to think about the goa
in scotland , the government - as platennaniya es.en.pi. - the most successful mittwyyita-virodhi in europe is a political campaign , the labour chancellor elistair darling of the proposed ( and by the opposition to the cuts carried ) and his preshyat tory-lib dem alliance , on the basis of the year in 2011 , won a majority thaa
the time for scotland to vote for independence would be absurd thing to do , because in that case the berlin and brussels to be imposed by the rules to accept the parsimony hongea
